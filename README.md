This project is a Twitter Data Analysis Dashboard built using Streamlit. The main goal is to help users understand large collections of tweets in an easy, visual, and interactive way. Tweets are often unstructured and difficult to read one by one, so this dashboard provides tools to instantly explore key insights.

1. Tweet Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removes URLs, mentions, punctuation, and stopwords

Converts text into a cleaner format for analysis

2. Word Frequency Analysis

Identifies the most common words used in the tweets

Helps users understand what topics are discussed the most

3. Word Cloud Generation

Creates a visual word cloud representing the most frequent words in the dataset

Gives a quick snapshot of the main themes and topics

4. Data Exploration

Shows number of tweets, distribution, and patterns

5. Interactive UI
